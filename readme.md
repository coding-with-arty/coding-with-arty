## 🏫 Computer Science Student | Web Developer | Educator

I’m **Arty**, a Computer Science student at **University of Maine Augusta (UMA)** focused on **web technologies and full-stack development**. I’m passionate about building tools that make an impact and sharing knowledge with others.  

Currently, I serve as:  
- **Lead Developer** for the **Maine Bread of Life** online presence.

This repository is my **personal learning lab**, where I experiment with new frameworks, build web projects, and refine my development skills.

- **Experimentation over perfection** — prototypes, mini-projects, and creative solutions.  
- **Impact-focused** — building tools that matter, whether for learning or real-world use.
